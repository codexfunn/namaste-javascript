# ⏱️ Closures + `setTimeout()` in JavaScript – Interview Edition 💎

---

## 🔄 1. How Closures Work with `setTimeout()`

Closures let inner functions **remember** variables from their outer scope — even after the outer function has finished execution. When combined with `setTimeout`, they unlock some surprising behavior.

### 🔥 Example:

```js
function demo() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i); // Logs: 4, 4, 4 😱
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}
demo();
```

> Why 4? Because by the time `setTimeout` runs, the loop is over, and `i` is 4. Closures point to the **same memory** for `i`.

---

## ✅ 2. Fix with `let` (Block Scope)

```js
function demo() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i); // 1, 2, 3 ✅
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}
demo();
```

> `let` creates a new block-scoped `i` each time — closure captures **correct value**.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Fix with IIFE (Classic Closure Trick)

```js
function demo() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    (function (j) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(j); // 1, 2, 3 ✅
      }, j * 1000);
    })(i);
  }
}
demo();
```

> Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) **locks in** the value of `i` by passing it as an argument.

---

## 🧠 4. Key Concepts You Must Understand

* `setTimeout` is **asynchronous**, pushed to Web API, and re-enters call stack via **event loop**.
* Closure captures **references**, not values.
* `var` is **function scoped**, so only **one copy** of `i` exists.
* `let` is **block scoped**, creates a **new copy** per iteration.

## 🧩 5. Real-World Scenario

Suppose you're looping through buttons and want to attach click listeners:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  document.getElementById("btn" + i).addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("You clicked button #" + i);
  });
}
```

### ❌ All buttons log: "You clicked button #5"

### ✅ Fix with Closure:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  (function (index) {
    document.getElementById("btn" + index).addEventListener("click", function () {
      console.log("You clicked button #" + index);
    });
  })(i);
}
```

## 🧨 6. Common Interview Questions

### Q1: Why does `setTimeout` inside a loop print the same value?

> Because `var` is function-scoped, and `setTimeout` callbacks run **after** the loop ends. All callbacks reference the same `i`.

---

### Q2: How do you fix it?

* Use `let` (ES6 block scope)
* Use IIFE to create a new scope per iteration

---

### Q3: What is a closure?

> A closure is a function that **remembers** variables from its **lexical environment**, even after the outer function has finished.

---

### Q4: Can closures be used with async operations like timers?

> Yes — in fact, closures are **essential** for maintaining state across async operations.

---

## ✅ TL;DR Summary

* `setTimeout()` inside loops + `var` = shared scope = wrong values.
* `let` or IIFE = isolated scope = correct values.
* Closures + `setTimeout()` = core test of your JS fundamentals.
* Master this pattern and you’ve cleared one of JS’s most notorious traps 🧠🔐
