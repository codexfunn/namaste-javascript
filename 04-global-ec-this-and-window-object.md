# 🌍 JavaScript: Global Execution Context, `this`, and Window Object – Diamond Notes

---

## 🧠 Is an Empty JS File the Shortest Program?

Yes, it is! Even an **empty JavaScript file** is enough for the JS engine to kick in and set the stage for execution. But here’s the catch:

> Even with no code, the **JavaScript engine** creates a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** automatically!

---

## 🔄 What Happens Internally with an Empty File?

1. **Global Execution Context is created.**
2. `this` keyword is initialized to refer to the **global object**.
3. In browsers, the **global object is `window`**.
4. Memory is reserved, and the thread is ready to execute — even if there’s no code to run.

---

## 🌐 What is the Global Object?

### In a browser:

* The global object is `window`
* It represents everything globally accessible: `setTimeout`, `alert`, `document`, even your variables (declared with `var`)

### In Node.js:

* The global object is `global`

---

## 🤯 `this` in the Global Context

```js
console.log(this); // window
console.log(this === window); // true
```

> In the **Global Execution Context**, `this` refers to the `window` object.

This is why the following is valid:

```js
var a = 10;
console.log(window.a); // 10
console.log(this.a);   // 10
```

---

## 🚀 Code Example: Global vs Local Scope

```js
var a = 10;
function f() {
  var x = 20;
}

console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
```

### 🔍 Why the Error?

* `x` is **declared inside** the function `f`, so it's scoped to that function.
* When you try to `console.log(x)` from global scope, JavaScript **searches `x` in the global memory**, doesn't find it, and throws `ReferenceError` (not `undefined`).

### ✨ Key Rule:

> If something is **declared with `var` in a function**, it stays **within that function's execution context**.

---

## ⚔️ `undefined` vs `not defined`

| Term          | Meaning                      | Example                 | Error? |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------ |
| `undefined`   | Declared but not initialized | `var x; console.log(x)` | ❌ No   |
| `not defined` | Never declared in any scope  | `console.log(y)`        | ✅ Yes  |

---

## 🧠 Bonus: What Happens When You Run JS Code?

Even for a file like this:

```js
// empty.js
```

JS engine still runs these steps:

1. Creates the **Global Execution Context**
2. Initializes `this` to `window`
3. Creates memory space for all global declarations (none in this case)
4. Starts the **code execution phase** — but finds nothing, so ends

---

## ✅ TL;DR Summary

* ✔️ Yes, an empty `.js` file is a valid program — but JS still sets up the full environment!
* 🌍 `this` in global scope = `window` (in browsers)
* 🧠 Global EC is **always** created first
* ⚠️ Variables declared in functions are **not accessible globally**
* 🔥 `undefined` ≠ `not defined`
